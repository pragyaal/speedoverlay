# Privacy Policy for Speed Overlay

**Last Updated: November 7, 2025**

## Introduction

Speed Overlay ("we," "our," or "the app") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

### Location Data
The app accesses your device's GPS location **only** to calculate your current speed. This data is:
- Processed locally on your device
- **NOT sent to any servers**
- **NOT stored or logged**
- Used only for real-time speed calculation
- Discarded immediately after calculation

### Data We DO NOT Collect
We want to be clear about what we DON'T collect:
- ❌ No personal information
- ❌ No user accounts or profiles
- ❌ No usage analytics
- ❌ No crash reports
- ❌ No advertising identifiers
- ❌ No cookies or tracking
- ❌ No location history
- ❌ No trip data or routes

## How We Use Information

Location data is used exclusively to:
1. Calculate your current speed in real-time
2. Display speed on the overlay
3. Track average and maximum speed during active session
4. Calculate acceleration/deceleration

All calculations happen locally on your device. Nothing is transmitted to external servers.

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only
The app stores minimal settings locally on your device:
- Transparency preferences
- Speed limit setting
- Night mode preference

These settings:
- Are stored using Android SharedPreferences
- Remain on your device only
- Can be cleared by uninstalling the app

### No Cloud Storage
We do not use any cloud storage or remote servers. All data stays on your device.

## Third-Party Services

### Google Play Services Location API
The app uses Google Play Services Location API to access GPS data. This is a standard Android API. Please review [Google's Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy) for information about how Google handles location data.

### Google Maps Integration
If you use Speed Overlay with Google Maps, Google's services are subject to their own privacy policy. We do not have access to data collected by Google Maps.

### No Other Third Parties
We do not integrate with:
- Analytics services
- Advertising networks
- Social media platforms
- Any other third-party services

## Permissions

The app requests the following permissions:

### Required Permissions:
1. **ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION** - To calculate speed from GPS
2. **ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION** - Backup location source
3. **SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW** - To display overlay over other apps
4. **FOREGROUND_SERVICE** - To keep overlay running
5. **POST_NOTIFICATIONS** - To show foreground service notification

### Why We Need These Permissions:
- **Location**: Essential for speed calculation
- **Overlay**: To display speed over Google Maps
- **Foreground Service**: To keep app running while you navigate
- **Notifications**: Android requirement for foreground services

## Children's Privacy

Speed Overlay is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect information from children. The app is designed for licensed vehicle operators and requires GPS functionality.

## Data Security

Since we don't collect or transmit data:
- There is no data to be compromised
- Your privacy is protected by design
- No server-side security concerns
- All processing is local and secure

## Your Rights

You have complete control over your data:
- **Access**: All data is local and visible in settings
- **Deletion**: Uninstall the app to remove all data
- **Control**: Revoke permissions anytime in Android settings
- **Portability**: Not applicable (no data collection)

## Changes to Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted within the app and on this page. Continued use after changes constitutes acceptance.

## Data Retention

- **Real-time data**: Immediately discarded after display
- **Session data** (avg/max speed): Cleared when overlay stops
- **Settings**: Stored until app is uninstalled

## International Users

The app works globally. All data processing occurs locally on your device regardless of your location. No cross-border data transfers occur.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

Under CCPA, California residents have the right to:
- Know what personal information is collected
- Delete personal information
- Opt-out of sale of personal information

**Our Response**: We don't collect personal information, so these rights are not applicable. Nothing to know, delete, or opt-out from.
